Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon Challenge #2, 2024

I leveraged real-world data provided by Gilead Sciences. The data contain information on a patient's demographics, diagnoses, insurance, and climate patterns. I predicted days to diagnose metastatic TNBC breast cancer using a neural network with TensorFlow-Keras, cleaned data using multivariate imputation (i.e. kNNImputer), and transformed data using one hot encoder.

For future steps, I would build my model based on top features using feature selection, as this was shared to reduce RMSE by Datathon winners.
