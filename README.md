Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon Challenge #2, 2024

I leveraged real-world data containing patient demographics, diagnoses, insurance, and climate patterns and predicted days to diagnose metastatic TNBC breast cancer using a neural network with TensorFlow-Keras. Cleaned data using multivariate imputation (i.e. kNNImputer) and transformed data using one hot encoder.

For future steps, I would build my model based on top features using feature selection, as this was shared to reduce RMSE by Datathon winners.
